## Basic functionality

### Authentication

**Endpoints:**

```
POST /api/auth/signup
```

```
POST /api/auth/login
```

```
POST /api/auth/logout
```

```
POST /api/auth/refresh_token
```

_The names speak for themselves_

The application uses JWT tokens for authentication. Users have three roles: regular user, moderator, and administrator.
The first user is an administrator.

To implement different access levels (regular user, moderator, and administrator),
FastAPI decorators are used to check the token and user role.

### Working with photos

**Users can perform various operations related to photos:**

- Upload photos with descriptions.
  ```
  POST /api/images/
  ```
- Delete photos.
  ```
  DELETE /api/images/{image_id}
  ```
- Edit photo descriptions.
  ```
  PATCH /api/images/{image_id}
  ```
- Retrieve a photo by a unique id.
  ```
  GET /api/images/{image_id}
  ```
- Add up to 5 tags per photo.

- Retrieve all your photos.

  ```
  GET /api/images/
  ```

- Apply basic photo transformations using
  [Cloudinary services](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_transformations).
  ```
  POST /api/transform/create_transformed/{original_image_id}
  ```
- Generate links to transformed images for viewing as URL and QR-code. Links are stored on the server.

  ```
  POST /api/transform/{transformed_pic_id}/qr
  ```

- Retrieve a transformed photo by a unique id.

  ```
  GET /api/transform/{transformed_pic_id}
  ```

- Retrieve all your transformed photos.

  ```

- Delete an existed transformed picture.
  ```
  DELETE /api/transform/{transformed_pic_id}/
  ```
  Administrators can perform all CRUD operations with user photos.

### Comments

- Add and read comments to each other's photos.

  ```
  POST /api/comments/
  ```
